## Software
The In Pe' prototype is built on top of the *RePhone* hardware by SeeedStudio.
More info on how to get started with the RePhone and the RePhone development environment can be found in the wiki section of the repo *[coming soon...]*

In the software folder of the repository are various Arduino .ino sketches, all of them can be ran by the RePhone hardware:
* in the software root folder are the updated main sketches of the In Pe' prototype (the "-Test" version has been implemented for the user testing campaign)
* in the utilities folder is a collection of sketches to test, calibrate and debug the hardware. They are useful to setup and customize an In Pe', and for developers willing to contribute to the project.

## Hardware
In the hardware section of the repository are the source files for the case *[coming soon...]*
