During the past months the Municipality of Milan and WeMake met groups of citizens and collaborative communities to start engaging them in Opencare.

Then we organized three co-design sessions, which involved participants from different backgrounds and with different needs.  Check the reports written by Municipality of Milan  for each sessions: [first](https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare-research/report-local-activity-co-design) - [second](https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare-research/report-local-activity-co-design-second-session) - [third](https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare-research/report-local-activity-co-design-3)  and [explore the gallery on Flickr.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wemake_cc/albums/72157667820435861)  

Wanna know more about methodology? opencare Playbook aka "Co-designing care services: a practical guide" is a little contribute for all innovators who wants to start to make a change in their community. The Playbook describes a general path for starting collaborative processes that you can adapt as needed. The playbook is related to engagement processes (local and online), co-design sessions, prototyping and sharing documentation as parts of the entire process.
